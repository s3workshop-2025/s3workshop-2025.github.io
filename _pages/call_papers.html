        <p align="justify">The Wireless of the Students, by the Students, and for the Students Workshop provides a unique venue for graduate students around the world to present, discuss, and exchange ideas on cross-cutting research on mobile wireless networks. As the name suggests, the workshop is organized by students, and the technical sessions are given by student presenters. The first author of each submission must be a student. The workshop aims at fostering early-career development among students and exposing them to the workings of academic life. It provides a venue for students to learn about each others’ work and discover opportunities for collaboration. </p>

          <h2 class="section-title multiple-title">Three Minute Thesis (3MT) Competition</h2>
          <p align="justify">
            3MT is developed by The University of Queensland for showcasing research done by PhD researchers. 3MT cultivates students’ academic, presentation, and research communication skills.
            The competition supports their capacity to effectively explain their research in three minutes, in a language appropriate to a non-specialist audience. Participating in 3MT develops academic, presentation and research communication skills, while developing research candidates’ ability to effectively explain their research in language appropriate to a non-specialist audience. Plus, it comes with the opportunity to win prizes!.</p>
          <p align="justify">
		        The title of these papers must bear a "3MT:" prefix and should be a one-page abstract with the same format for paper submission.
          
            Contestants should prepare a one-slide presentation of the topic they plan to present for maximum of 3 minutes during the ACM S3 3MT competition. You should adhere to the standard 3MT competition rules listed
            <a href="https://threeminutethesis.uq.edu.au/resources/competition-rules" style="color:blue" target="_blank">here</a>.

            We will be using the standard judging criteria for 3MT competition at ACM S3 which can be accessed <a href="https://threeminutethesis.uq.edu.au/resources/judging-criteria-and-panel" style="color:blue" target="_blank">here</a>. Awards will be announced at the end of the event.

            Before final submission, you are expected to make sure that your paper complies with the following requirements. Please do not violate these requirements with the aim of including additional material: submissions that violate the formatting requirements may not be reviewed. 
            <!--You can visually inspect a page-by-page report of your paper format using the same tool as the submission system via a separate ​online form. After the submission deadline, we will use the same tool to check the conformance of papers. The format checking tool uses heuristics and can make mistakes. The PC chairs will manually inspect and possibly reject those papers with evident format violations. However, no paper will be rejected due to format violations without being manually checked. -->

            Any papers that do not adhere to the following guidelines may be immediately rejected:

        <h2 class="section-title multiple-title">Panel Discussions</h2>
        <p align="justify">Our panel discussions' format focuses on the Q&A style that we encourage more questions asked
          from the student audience. There will be a shortlist of curated questions from the moderator, and most importantly, we
          aim to allocate most of the time to the student audiences' questions. Please email chairs if you are interested to join as a panelist.</p>
